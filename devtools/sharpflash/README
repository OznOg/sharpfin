PROGRAMS
========

sharpflash
----------

This program drives a wiggler-style parallel port JTAG adaptor, and contains
functions to manage the NAND Flash memory of a Reciva Barracuda module.

The program is based on the sj2410 programmer by purnnamu, and the K3F1208 
patch by Robert Fitzsimons.

The program provides three functions:
-b	Bad block check - gives a visual indication of the good/bad blocks
	in the NAND flash.
-r	Read data.
-w	Write data.

Data is stored and handled in 'nanddump' format, i.e. the data file is
organised in pages, each page containing 512 bytes of data followed by 16
bytes of extra (out of band) data.  The 512 bytes is actual data from the disk,
and the 16 bytes contains error correction codes.

getpart
-------

This program is used to extract partition data from a contiguous file that is
not in 'nanddump' format, such as the programming mtd.bin files used during
the Reciva upgrades.

This program uses a modified version of the nand_ecc.c file, which is included
in the linux kernel, and was originally developed by Steven J Hill, Toshiba.

LICENSE
=======

sharpflash and getpart are released under the GNU General Public License v3.
Please read LICENSE for more information.

COMPILING
=========

The programs are built using 'gcc', and compilation is performed with:
  make

For the Linux platform, and on the Windows platform, please use:
  make -f Makefile.windows

Note that by default, on a Linux hosts, sharpflash uses device /dev/parport0,
and this must either be accessible by a mortal user, or the sharpflash program
must be run as root.

Note that on windows, the program tries to open ports LPT1: LPT2: and LPT3:,
and will use the first successful port.  sharpflash has only been tested on
a Linux platform.
