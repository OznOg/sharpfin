This directory contains the reciva kernel files and additional drivers.
The directory linux_bast contains the latest version of the kernel -
reciva release can be found in RECIVA_KERNEL_VERSION

Note that Git only holds the include files (to keep the size down).
If the full kernel source is needed, it can be obtained from:
http://copper.reciva.com/sources

The drivers directory contains additional drivers, which are built with
the latest kernel.
