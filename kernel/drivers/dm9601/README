A. Compiler command:

   A-1: For normal single processor kernel
        "gcc -DMODULE -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux/include -Wall 
          -Wstrict-prototypes -O6 -c dm9601.c"

   A-2: For single processor and set version info on all module symbol
        "gcc -DMODULE -DMODVERSIONS -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux/include
          -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O6 -c dm9601.c"

   A-3: For multiple processors(SMP) and set ver. info. on all module symbol
        "gcc -D__SMP__ -DMODULE -DMODVERSIONS -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux
         /include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O6 -c dm9601.c"

   	Note: O of -O6 is a capital "o", not a "0".
      

B. How to compile driver 

   B-1: Login by supervisor
   B-2: Copy dm9601.c and Makefile into your HD. You can make a new directoty
        to put.
   B-3: Keep driver source file name as "dm9601.c" and makefile name as 
    "Makefile"
   B-4: You can type the following command to compile driver. Please according
   	  to your system to pick one.
   		make org	;;Without SMP support 
   		make mod	;;Set version info on all module symbol
   		make smp	;;symmetric multi-processing(SMP) support
   		make smp_mod	;;SMP & Set version info on module

   	  Or you can type above compiler command to compile driver.
   		
   	  Note: Please check you must have the right kernel source on 
   	      "/usr/src/linux".


C. The following steps teach you how to activate NIC:

   C-1: A simple and temporary method

      1. Used the upper compiler command to compile dm9601.c

      2. Insert DM9601 module into kernel
         "insmod dm9601.o"           ;;Auto Detection Mode (Suggest)
         "insmod dm9601.o mode=0"    ;;Force 10M Half Duplex
         "insmod dm9601.o mode=1"    ;;Force 100M Half Duplex
         "insmod dm9601.o mode=4"    ;;Force 10M Full Duplex
         "insmod dm9601.o mode=5"    ;;Force 100M Full Duplex

     NOTE: You can type "man insmod" to see more description.

      3. Config a DM9601 network interface
         "ifconfig eth0 172.22.3.18"
                        ^^^^^^^^^^^ Your IP address

     NOTE: 1. You can type "man ifconfig" to see more description.
  	 2. If eth0 has been used, you should use eth1 instead.

      4. Activate the IP routing table. For some distributions, it is not
         necessary. You can type "route" to check.

         "route add default netmask 255.255.255.0 eth0"

     NOTE: 1. You can type "man route" to see more description.
  	 2. If eth0 has been used, you should use eth1 instead.

      5. Well done. Your DM9601 adapter actived now.

  Note. This is a temporary method. After you reboot the system, you
        will lost the setting.

   C-2: For Redhat, You can use the following to Activate NIC
  
  1.  login your system used the superuser.
  2.  copy dm9601.o into	/lib/modules/2.4.x/kernel/drivers/net/
  3.  add the new line with "alias eth0 dm9601" in "/etc/module.conf". 
  4.  execute "netconfig -d eth0".
  5.  Fill your IP address, netmask and gateway
  6.  press <ok> to confirm and exit this setting
  7   reboot
  Note. If eth0 has been used, you should use eth1 instead.
