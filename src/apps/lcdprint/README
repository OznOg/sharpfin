lcdprint

OVERVIEW

This is a simple program, to print some text on the LCD display.  It is
provided for use in install scripts, to inform the user on the current state
of play (rather than installing blind).

It displays each of its args on a separate line on the display.

Note that not all screens have 4 lines, so take care whe writing generic
scripts. Although the app won't crash, the user won't see the bottom lines.


EXAMPLE
lcdprint "Top Line" "Middle Line" "Third Line" "Fourth Line"
