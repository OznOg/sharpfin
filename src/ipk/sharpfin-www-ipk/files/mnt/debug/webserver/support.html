<b>This software ain't going to write itself!</b>
</p>
<p>
Seriously, though, we need people to have a go, and take on little projects to get 
the radio going.  An easy start is to write plugins for the webserver, such as 
scripts to manage the favorites or alarms.
More adventurous is to write an application to control the radio via the lirc remote
control daemon.
More adventurous still is to build a completely indepenent radio application, starting with
the Helix radio application.
